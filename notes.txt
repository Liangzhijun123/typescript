-to run the typescript type 'tsc main.ts -w' continue to watch main.ts for any changes

1: 'tsc main.ts'
2: click go live server in vscode at the bottom
3: 'tsc main.ts -w' in order to recompile JS so it watch if the file is changed

File structure 
-build (HTML, CSS, JS, nested directory)
-src (raw files, components, Typescript)

4:'tsc --init' to initalize the file

5: uncomment "rootDir": "./src" in tsconfig.json file
  uncomment "outDir": "./build/js", 
  -'./src' because it is where typscript file will be
  -'./build/js' so now JS can compile here

6: tsc -w will now look for all the files in the directories

'"target": "es2016", ' recompile JS variables to be 'let' instead of 'var'

If i want to delete a file in 'ts' you have to delete 'js' too
If you put a ts file in the root (dont do it), it also compile the js in the root 

scroll down to end of tsconfig.json and include 
  - "include": [
    "src"
  ]
  -now when you creat a file in root it doesn't pop out the js file

-uncomment out '"noEmitOnError": true,' in tsconfig.json it lets JS compile or typescript error
-comment out '"noEmitOnError": true,' so we can see the typescript error
